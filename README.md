The program is written in C# and features custom-designed algorithms for each function.
It does not directly utilize existing image processing algorithms, such as algorithms in OpenCV.

The included functions are as follows:

- [RGB Extraction & Transformation](#1)
- [Smooth Filter (Mean and Median)](#2)
- [Histogram Equalization](#3)
- [User-Defined Thresholding](#4)
- [Sobel Edge Detection](#5)
- [Edge Overlapping](#6)
- [Connected Component](#7)
- [Image Registration](#8)

<h2 id="1">RGB Extraction & Transformation</h2>

Extract the R, G, and B channels from the color image and transform it into a grayscale image.

Color extraction: Extract R, G, and B channels to each image

Color transformation: Change the color image to a gray scale image
